# Data Engineering using Python SqlAlchemy & Sqlite Database


## Data:
  - Hawaii weather station temperature, precipitation readings.
  - Hawaii weather data from different stations over a period of year 2010 till 2015.

In this project I use sqlAlchemy to establish connection of sqlite database to python. Then I query the imported datasets to answers qestions and to derive insights.
Some key points in this climate analysis:
  - precipitation analysis
